## Service

This repository contains a minimal backend service API based on the [Falcon](http://falconframework.org/) framework, [Pandas DataPackage Reader](https://github.com/rgieseke/pandas-datapackage-reader), and the [Falcon plugin](https://github.com/alysivji/falcon-apispec) for [apispec](https://apispec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
